""" SystemD Service Management functions for OpenSwitch nodes

This file is part of the Topology Modular Framework Common Code Library.
It uses systemd (systemctl), the default service manager in OpenSwitch.

This module is not supported in:
    - Modular Topology objects that do not support the Bash shell
    - Systems that do not use systemd as its service manager
